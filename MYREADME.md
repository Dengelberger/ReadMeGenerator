  ## Description 
  
  This is a README.md file generator. Its purpose is to help build a professional looking readme file for each project I add to my GitHub repositories.  It is useful information for others who are reviewing my work, wanting to use my work, and trying to gain an understanding of my work.

  ## Installation 
  
  Access the README generator by pulling the files  from my GitHub repository.  You can run the generator from your terminal command line by typing "node index.js". You will be given a series of prompts to follow.  When it is done, you will have created a new file called MYREADME.md where you can see all of your responses.

  ## Usage 
  
  This program is used to generate a README.md file called MYREADME.md.  Here are some pictures of what the command line prompts look like as well as the finished product.

  ## Contributing 
  
  In this section you can give credit to anyone who has assisted in the development of your project.  You can also let people know they can add to your project through specific steps. (I am not sure what I will include for that part.)


  ## Tests 
  
  
In the future this section will contain information on how to run tests of the project. This material is not yet covered in class.

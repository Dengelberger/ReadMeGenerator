  ## Description 
  
  This is my professional portfolio website. It includes a landing page that shows my photo and a short bio, as well as icons of the various developer tools I have learned and can use. It includes a portfolio page with cards that show my various projects, where the user can launch the project or view the GitHub repo. It also includes a contact form which will soon be functional and allow the user to contact me via email.
